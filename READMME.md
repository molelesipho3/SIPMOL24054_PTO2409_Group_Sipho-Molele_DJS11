# Podcast App

This is a podcast application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It allows users to discover, listen to, and manage their favorite podcasts.

## Features

- Browse and search for podcasts
- Listen to episodes with a built-in audio player
- Mark episodes as favorites
- User authentication and profile management (planned)
- Responsive design


## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd podcast-app
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd podcast-app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

## How to Run the Project

To run the project in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/` (or the port indicated in your terminal).

## Deployment

The application can be built for production using:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready build. These files can then be served by any static file server.

## Project Status

This project is a continuation of a previous task. Initial technical issues related to Tailwind CSS configuration and host blocking have been resolved. The application is now functional, and further enhancements like real audio playback, user authentication, and UI improvements are planned or in progress.
